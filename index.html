                    <h2>The Bride</h2>
                    <p>Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Mara grew up as the eldest of three sisters. She graduated from North Allegheny High School and briefly attended Campbell College in North Carolina before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh for pharmacy in 2014 (to the great joy of her father). A constant presence in her church, Pittsburgh Chinese Church, and fellowships, Mara is known for her kind and caring demeanor to friends and strangers alike. She is also famous for her ability to sleep for long periods of time and for her beloved chinchilla, Pabu.</p>

                    <h2>The Groom</h2>
                    <p>Phil grew up as the middle child between two strong-willed sisters, resulting in a very reconciliatory and laidback personality. He was born in New Jersey and lived in Taiwan for a few years before returning back to New Jersey in his elementary school years. He briefly attended Rutgers University before transferring to Carnegie Mellon University in 2012 to study materials engineering. After realizing his grave mistake, he enrolled in the University of Chicago in 2017 to study computer science. Phil is known for his pleasantly awkward presence and face-crinkling grin, as well as his avid devotion to the Boston Celtics and the beautiful sport of basketball.</p>

                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <div class="mara">
                    <h2>Her Half of the Story</h2>
                    <p>I first became aware of Phil&#8217;s existence when I saw him all over the Asian Christian Fellowship (ACF)&#8217;s winter retreat pictures back in 2013. It was the first ACF retreat I hadn&#8217;t attended and immediately noted that he must be new. I wasn&#8217;t even sure if he was completely Asian, maybe a halfie? As I came home for the summer I started to pick up some pieces of information about him:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>He&#8217;s a PK (pastor&#8217;s kid)</li>
                        <li>A transfer student (sooo older than me +1)</li>
                        <li>Definitely not a halfie (so much love for Taiwan)</li>
                        <li>He&#8217;s only interested in basketball, aka the Celtics</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I soon realized that he was everywhere and friends with everyone. I didn&#8217;t hang out much with the ACFers then because I didn&#8217;t think I would end up going back to Pittsburgh and wasn&#8217;t worth investing my time.</p>
                    <p>BUT then I found out I got into Pitt&#8217;s pharmacy school in the summer of 2014 and Phil started messaging me about a friend out of the blue. He got the piece of information that he wanted and seemed like he wanted to end the conversation there. I tried to make him talk to me for just a little longer and ended up talking for hours. And he reached out to me and talked for the same amount of time the next day. But the third day.... nothing. So I played it off, it was cool... he just wanted to be friends!</p>
                    <p>Then the next school year came... and by winter time, I knew that I liked him. We texted for hours on multiple occasions late into the night into the next days, but some times he would just completely stop. When I saw him in person, he never said hello and even seemed to avoid me. Was he texting out of politeness? Was he awkwarded out? OR maybe he just really wanted to tell me that we were just friends. So as confused as I was, I gave up. And I have a lot of pride, so I said goodbye to him and wished him luck as he moved onto Massachusetts.</p>
                    <p>FAST FORWARD 1 YEAR</p>
                    <p>Samuel Lee (Phil and my mutual friend) and I are sitting in my living room very late at night. Stephanie Mao (my cousin in law) accidentally let it slip that I liked someone in undergrad... then conveniently goes to bed some time later. Sam immediately jumps on the opportunity, and long story short convinces me to allow him to tell Phil.</p>

                    <h2> His Half of the Story</h2>
                    <p>I first heard of Mara in my first Sunday at Pittsburgh Chinese Church in the fall of 2012, where I met a very distraught Julie Ott, who was mourning the departure of her dearest first child to Campbell College. The next summer, I met the dearest first child when she returned home for the summer. However, we didn&#8217;t talk until two years later, in the summer of 2014, when I suddenly decided to message her on Facebook to talk about one of our mutual friends who was going through a rough time. We ended up chatting for hours on end for several days, before I suddenly stopped messaging her because I felt that we talked too much to be appropriate for a new friendship. However, as the months rolled on, I found myself in long texting conversations with Mara, exchanging thoughts on being children of clergymen and talking about our families and our lives. I found myself enjoying them more and more, and enjoying Mara more and more.</p>
                    <p>Being ever the awkward buffoon, I found it hard to talk to her more in person because I felt she was too pretty for me to talk to and found myself without words when I had the opportunity. So I slowly shrunk away as I got closer to my graduation from CMU, and I moved away for Massachusetts for work.</p>
                    <p>While I was in Massachusetts, I still occasionally texted Mara and Snapchatted her, but had given up hope at that point of seeing her again. Luckily, one of my future groomsmen, Sam, decided to take matters into his own hands and called me, politely informing me that Mara did feel similarly when I was in Pittsburgh and telling me to pull my (butt) in shape and stop being so awkward. I gathered my courage, called Mara, and after some more awkward hemming and hawing, we started dating on June 21, 2016.</p>
                    <p>Long distance came with its challenges, but both Mara and I were determined to see things through and love each other through it all. Our dedication, combined with a heavy dose of God&#8217;s providence and grace, pulled us through thick and thin. After a year, we decided to jump into the fast lane and I proposed to Mara on August 25, 2017.</p>

She is known for her contagious laugh and her ability to pull out Spongebob qutoes and reference episodes. Abbey had to endure listening to many of Phil and Mara&#8217;s long distance conversations over the phone… and so she was given maid of honor.</p>

                        <p>Victor is Phil's good friend who stuck with him since Phil first transferred to CMU in his sophomore year. Victor and Phil started their friendship on purely physical basis, communicating through hugs and caresses before progressing to talking and sharing (and being accountability partners) over 5 years.

                        <p>Lydia is Mara&#8217;s middle sister. She is the epitome of a second child and is the drama queen of the three. Although her personality is big, she is super loyal and caring to those she loves. She also really enjoys to verbally harass Phil.

                        <p>Calvin was an older figure in Asian Christian Fellowship when Phil joined in 2012, but they became close through their common love for anime and basketball. They became closer when they started playing video games together with Victor, eventually becoming an accountability group together. Calvin enjoys music, singing, watching and playing basketball, anime, and keeping Phil and Victor in line. He currently is in his final year of dental school in Philadelphia.</p>

Currently, she is a school teacher and supporting her husband as he finishes medical school (when she can finally &ldquo;retire&rdquo; jk). She is known for her doodles, clumsiness, record in losing things, and her distinct voice. She is one of the most dog-loving, friendly, and kind-hearted person you will ever meet. Also shoutout for naming her hamster, Mr. Fluffybuns and for being a bridesmaid <em>again</em> for her (like) 100th time.</p>

                        <h4>Groomsman</h4>
                        <p>Sam and Phil first became friends when Phil accidentally played 2 seconds of a song from the soundtrack of Code Geass in his apartment when he was working. Sam immediately recognized which track it was and they became fast friends from then on. They connected quickly on both being pastor&#8217;s sons with twisted senses of humor and a penchant for destructive experiments - once burning all the hairs off of Sam's arm when they set Phil's water-filled kitchen sink on fire. Sam enjoys eating, collecting toys, quality TV shows and movies, and playing with fire (in more ways than one). Sam is currently seeking employment in the finance sector in Seattle.</p>

                        <p>Stephanie became an honorary Ott last June and is Mara&#8217;s cousin-in-law. She is often teased for being &ldquo;boujee&rdquo;. She received both her undergrad and master&#8217;s degree from Carnegie Mellon in electrical computer engineering. She has helped Mara with her romantic life and has been a guidance in getting Mara and Phil together. She loves to rock karaoke and can kill it on the dance floor.</p>

                        <p>Bryan and Phil first connected with each other when Phil began to gain an interest in audiophile products. Bryan, being a refined audiophile at that staged, showed Phil the way. They also served together on leadership for Asian Christian Fellowship, and were accountability partners together with Victor while they were in college. Bryan is also very remarkable for being a Lakers fan who doesn't rub it in people's faces. Bryan enjoys quality audio, quality NBA games, and quality time with other people. Bryan is currently a software engineer in the Bay Area.</p>

                        <p>Susie and Mara became friends while attending the University of Pittsburgh and is pretty much a &ldquo;sister from another mother&rdquo;. Her personality and thinking process is pretty much Mara but in a more extroverted way. They became instant friends when they knew hanging out meant napping and watching Bob&#8217;s Burgers together. She does differ from Mara by being a anti-hoarder/minimalist, wearing a cute and neat style, and by being &ldquo;that one friend that everyone knows&rdquo;. Currently, she is working and living it up in New York.</p>

Song and Phil became close in the summer of 2013 when they became accountability partners for one another, often sharing and praying on top of laundry machines in the apartment building they lived in. Song enjoys singing, watching Manchester United, and cats. Song also enjoys public displays of affection. Song is currently a sales representative in Pittsburgh.</p>

                        <p>Jackie and Mara became friends in college through many late-nights (not for studying). She allowed Mara to become her 3rd &ldquo;roommate&rdquo; during her senior year. She went to Carnegie Mellon to study computer science while Mara often distracted her from her work. Together, they learned how to not starve while not leaving the apartment through many nights of delivery and scrounging the pantry.</p>

                        <p>Dan and Phil were friends in high school in NJ, both serving on the audio team and in their youth group and church. They initially connected on being relatively tall. They became close at the end of high school and college when they commiserated about their problems making sense of girls. Since then, Dan has lived in Atlanta and Phoenix but Dan and Phil keep up whenever they are both back at home in NJ. Dan enjoys music production, basketball, and being a tree. Dan is currently working as an engineer in Flagstaff, AZ.</p>

                        <h4>Groomsman</h4>
                        <p>David and Phil met when Phil moved to Worcester, MA and attended David's church when he was invited by David's then-girlfriend-now-wife, Lucy. They quickly clicked in their mutual pursuit of genuine faith and grew very close, sharpening each other in their friendship. David enjoys sports, watching Liverpool, and asking (many) insightful questions. David is currently working as a researcher on Chinese politics and economics in Boston.</p>
