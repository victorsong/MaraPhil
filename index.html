                    <p>Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Mara grew up as the eldest of three sisters. She graduated from North Allegheny High School and briefly attended Campbell College in North Carolina before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh for pharmacy in 2014 (to the great joy of her father). A constant presence in her church, Pittsburgh Chinese Church, and fellowships, Mara is known for her kind and caring demeanor to friends and strangers alike. She is also famous for her ability to sleep for long periods of time and for her beloved chinchilla, Pabu.</p>

                    <p>Phil grew up as the middle child between two strong-willed sisters, resulting in a very reconciliatory and laidback personality. He was born in New Jersey and lived in Taiwan for a few years before returning back to New Jersey in his elementary school years. He briefly attended Rutgers University before transferring to Carnegie Mellon University in 2012 to study materials engineering. After realizing his grave mistake, he enrolled in the University of Chicago in 2017 to study computer science. Phil is known for his pleasantly awkward presence and face-crinkling grin, as well as his avid devotion to the Boston Celtics and the beautiful sport of basketball.</p>

                <div class="mara">
                    <h2>Her Half of the Story</h2>
                    <p>I first became aware of Phil&#8217;s existence when I saw him all over the Asian Christian Fellowship (ACF)&#8217;s winter retreat pictures back in 2013. It was the first ACF retreat I hadn&#8217;t attended and immediately noted that he must be new. I wasn&#8217;t even sure if he was completely Asian, maybe a halfie? As I came home for the summer I started to pick up some pieces of information about him:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>He&#8217;s a PK (pastor&#8217;s kid)</li>
                        <li>A transfer student (sooo older than me +1)</li>
                        <li>Definitely not a halfie (so much love for Taiwan)</li>
                        <li>He&#8217;s only interested in basketball, aka the Celtics</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I soon realized that he was everywhere and friends with everyone. I didn&#8217;t hang out much with the ACFers then because I didn&#8217;t think I would end up going back to Pittsburgh and wasn&#8217;t worth investing my time.</p>
                    <p>BUT then I found out I got into Pitt&#8217;s pharmacy school in the summer of 2014 and Phil started messaging me about a friend out of the blue. He got the piece of information that he wanted and seemed like he wanted to end the conversation there. I tried to make him talk to me for just a little longer and ended up talking for hours. And he reached out to me and talked for the same amount of time the next day. But the third day.... nothing. So I played it off, it was cool... he just wanted to be friends!</p>
                    <p>Then the next year came... and by winter time, I knew that I liked him. We texted for hours on multiple occasions late into the night into the next days, but some times he would just completely stop. When I saw him in person, he never said hello and even seemed to avoid me. Was he texting out of politeness? Was he awkwarded out? OR maybe he just really wanted to tell me that we were just friends. So as confused as I was, I gave up. And I have a lot of pride, so I said goodbye to him and wished him luck as he moved onto Massachusetts.</p>
                    <p>FAST FORWARD 1 YEAR</p>
                    <p>Samuel Lee (Phil and my mutual friend) and I are sitting in my living room very late at night. Stephanie Mao (my cousin in law) accidentally let it slip that I liked someone in undergrad... then conveniently goes to bed some time later. Sam immediately jumps on the opportunity, and long story short convinces me to allow him to tell Phil.</p>

                    <h2> His Half of the Story</h2>
                    <p>I first heard of Mara in my first Sunday at Pittsburgh Chinese Church in the fall of 2012, where I met a very distraught Julie Ott, who was mourning the departure of her dearest first child to Campbell College. The next summer, I met the dearest first child when she returned home for the summer. However, we didn&#8217;t talk until two years later, in the summer of 2014, when I suddenly decided to message her on Facebook to talk about one of our mutual friends who was going through a rough time. We ended up chatting for hours on end for several days, before I suddenly stopped messaging her because I felt that we talked too much to be appropriate for a new friendship. However, as the months rolled on, I found myself in long texting conversations with Mara, exchanging thoughts on being children of clergymen and talking about their families and their lives. I found myself enjoying them more and more, and enjoying Mara more and more.</p>
                    <p>Being ever the awkward buffoon, I found it hard to talk to her more in person because I felt she was too pretty for me to talk to and found myself without words when I had the opportunity. So I slowly shrunk away as I got closer to my graduation from CMU, and I moved away for Massachusetts for work.</p>
                    <p>While I was in Massachusetts, I still occasionally texted Mara and Snapchatted her, but had given up hope at that point of seeing her again. Luckily, one of my future groomsmen, Sam, decided to take matters into his own hands and called me, politely informing me that Mara did feel similarly when I was in Pittsburgh and telling me to pull my (butt) in shape and stop being so awkward. I gathered my courage, called Mara, and after some more awkward hemming and hawing, we started dating on June 21, 2016.</p>
                    <p>Long distance came with its challenges, but both Mara and I were determined to see things through and love each other through it all. Our dedication, combined with a heavy dose of God&#8217;s providence and grace, pulled us through thick and thin. After a year, we decided to jump into the fast lane and I proposed to Mara on August 25, 2017.</p>
